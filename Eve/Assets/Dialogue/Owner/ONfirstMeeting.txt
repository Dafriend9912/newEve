@Owner
Excuse me, who are you?
@You
I'm The Detective
@Owner
Detective??? I didn't hire a detective!!
What are you doing here! I'm a very busy man the last thing I need is a detective getting in my way!
@You
(Did The Bartender not mention I was going to be here...?)
I'm here about the possible upcoming murder.
@Owner
URGH!!!
You must've been talking to The Bartender, haven't you??
@You
Well yes, he aske-
@Owner
He's lost it! Absolutely gone of the deep end!
Murder? HAH!
Who does he think he is going against my authority?
@You
(Sounds like this guy isn't having the best day...)
@Owner
I told him he must be wrong, no murder would ever happen at MY club!
How dare he go behind my back and hire a detective!
And during this time! I'm much too busy as is!!
@You
(Sheesh he might be having more than just a bad day...)
@Owner
I suppose it's no matter, just try to stay out of my way okay? I'm very busy.
@You
Actually, I wanted to ask you some questions.
@Owner
Ok ok ok, but make it quick.
