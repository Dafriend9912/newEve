You:
You haven't been preparing for the Gala because you don't think it will happen!
I've only just got here but I can already tell that you're one of the future murderers!
I'm not sure who yet but if you murder someone on the night of the Gala, then why would you care if the decorations and such are set up?
You wouldn't. The Gala will be ruined either way, so why bother?

Owner:
WHAT?

You:
The bartender mentioned that one of the only phones in this club was in your office, you must have made the call a few nights ago!

Owner:
NO!
That's not true!
URGH... It's not that...
I'm...

You:
(is it possible there's something else I'm missing?)

Owner:
URGH...
I'm horribly lazy, alright?
I'd never even think about murder, I just... I can't make myself do the work I need to do.

You:
Huh?

Owner:
That's why I'm always busy, because I never seem to get any of my work done.
To be truthful, there's no way I'd be able to run this club alone.

You:
(Sounds like all of his "big talk" was just to hide this from me)
So how are you running this club?

Owner:
It's the Stage Director, he helps me out the most.
I still think you're wrong about there being a murder, but even if you're not, it's not me.
