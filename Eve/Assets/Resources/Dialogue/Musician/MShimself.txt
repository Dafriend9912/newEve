@You
Can you tell me a bit more about yourself?
@Musician
Of course, but I'll have to keep it brief.
I've got a song I need to finish, and practice to do.
@You
A song?
@Musician
Yes.
You've no doubt heard about our Annual Crimson Gala.
I'm in the process of writing several pieces specifically for the night.
@You
Do you always do this?
@Musician
The owner pays me handsomely for my work. Does that answer your question?
@You
You do it for the money?
@Musician
Don't get me wrong, I truly do have a love for my craft, but money is what drives the world is it not?
That's why I've chosen my line of work.
If I wish to make more money, which I do, I must first make better music.
If I wish to make better music, I must first better myself.
I've married my passion and my desire for riches in such a beautifully sustaining way!
@You
Sounds like a productive drive.
@Musician
Money is truly the greatest motivator.
