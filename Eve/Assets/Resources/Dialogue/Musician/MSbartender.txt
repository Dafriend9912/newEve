@You
I'd like to go back a bit.
How did you and The Bartender become friends?
@Musician
We were friends before I even started working here.
He was the one who first mentioned me to The Owner.
Of course, I accepted the job opportunity.
@You
So you two have been good friends for awhile now?
@Musician
Yes, and when I started working here, we bonded even more.
Neither of us care about the Dancers too much.
I don't like them because they are too flagrant.
They steal attention away from my craft.
The music I play deserves a higher recognition than what it recieves here.
That being said, I am first and foremost a business man.
I recognize that the Dancers are vital to the survival of the club.
To remove them would be to upset the entire ecosystem upon which I make my living.
@You
(Interesting, I asked about his relation with The Bartender, and he opened up about the Dancers...)
@Musician
I did it again.
I get too caught up in answering, that I sometimes forget what the question is.
@You
That's fine, this has been helpful
(I probably got more information here than I would've had I just asked about the Dancers...)
