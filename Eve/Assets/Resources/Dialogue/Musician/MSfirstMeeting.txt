@You
Hello, you must be one of The Musicians here.
@Musician
I suppose.
@You
You suppose?
@Musician
Well there's nothing wrong with your statement.
However, that's not the entirety of it either.
@You
What are you getting at?
@Musician
Look at me... I despise people who waste my time, and here I am, wasting yours.
Forgive me, I'll be more straight forward.
Yes I'm one of The Musicians here, but I'm really the only musician here.
@You
What do you mean by that?
@Musician
There are others who play here of course, but to the untrained ear, I'm the only one worthy to be called "A musician".
Therefore, I prefer to stylize myself as "The Musician".
Don't get me wrong, I hold the others no ill will, but I'm the most successful here.
Ah. I've done it again haven't I?
I'm wasting your time.
You've no doubt got questions to ask me.
