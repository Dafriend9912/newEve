@You
You're good friends with The Bartender, no?
@Musician
Correct.
@You
He's told you what he's heard then?
@Musician
He has.
@You
Good. I'd like to know your thoughts on the case.
@Musician
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some thoughts on the case, however, I doubt any of it will be helpful to you.
@You
Fire away, the more I know the better.
@Musician
I think it's likely that both of the upcoming-murderers work in the club.
It's incredibly dangerous to make a call from inside the club.
Even when it's late at night, The Bartender is almost always there.
If at least one of the murderers works here, they must surely know that.
I suspect that the call was meant to be overheard.
This would deflect suspicion from one of them.
@You
An interesting idea.
But why go through the trouble of having the call be heard in the first place?
@Musician
That's what I've been struggling with too.
I can't come up with anything for that, but it doesn't sit right with me.
@You
I'll keep that idea in mind then. Thank you.
@Musician
Of course, I hope it proves helpful.
