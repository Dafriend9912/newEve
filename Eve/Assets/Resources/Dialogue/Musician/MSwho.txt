@You
How did you know I wanted to question you.
I haven't even introduced myself yet.
@Musician
I guess you could say I'm just perceptive.
No, that's not entirely true.
I'm good friends with the Bartender, the other day he mentioned hiring a detective.
And you, you're new here.
@You
So it was just a guess?
@Musician
I suppose you could call it that, but in Music, there is no guessing.
Chords follow a natural progression.
Each note is carefully selected to bring the song to life.
Much akin to the facts in your case, there are no "guesses" or "accidents".
A professional such as you or I must follow those rules set out before us, else we make mistakes.
@You
(I can't decide if he's arrogant, or smart...)
@Musician
Before we go further, I must clarify something.
@You
Yes?
@Musician
You must be wondering if I actually know what I'm talking about, or if I'm just a pompous asshole.
Only you can make that decision for yourself, but I will say that I have big plans for my future.
Maybe I'm not the largest name in the industry as of now, but I know how to get there.
