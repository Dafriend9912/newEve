This detective work is hard shit.
I haven't had a real case in almost 5 months now.
Sure I've had a few people drop by, but nothing more vexing than a case of lost keys.
I can tell I'm starting to lose my edge.
Like rust on a knife, all the signs are there.
I've noticed I don't think as creatively anymore, the first aspect of being a good detective.
Nor do I question as much as I should.
It's insane what effect 5 months behind a desk can have on the human mind.
Probably the biggest sign of my mental rust is the fact that I didn't even notice when the letter arrived.
It must have shown up today, I'm sure of that, but when? I couldn't say.
Although still unknown to me, it was a mundane question that no doubt had a mundane answer.
I've always believed that the best mysteries are often solved by the simplest of answers.
However, the simplest answers are never the first to present themselves, that's what makes the game of the detective so rousing.
The letter promised even more of these intoxicating questions.
A special event.
A popular nightclub.
A possible murder.
The Bartender who had signed the letter had left little else to go off of.
Already I could feel my mind beginning to shake off the dust that had settled.
The Bartender had asked for help.
I will visit this nightclub. Learn the details of his suspicion...
And if there is a murderer I will find them.
The game has begun.
