*6This detective work is *1<color=#FF0000>hard shit.<color=white>
I haven't had a real case in almost 5 months now.
Sure I've had a few people drop by, but nothing more vexing than a case of lost keys.
I can tell I'm starting to lose my edge.
Like rust on a dull knife, all the signs are there.
My critical thinking skills, possibly the most important aspect of being a good detective have gone to shit.
I'm stuck seeing things <i>as they appear.</i> I've forgotten to look at them for what <i>they could be.</i>
It's insane what an effect 5 months behind a desk can have on the human mind.
Probably the biggest sign of my mental rust is the fact that I didn't even notice when *2<color=#FF0000>The Letter<color=white> *3arrived.

It must have shown up today, I'm sure of that, but <i>when?</i> *3I couldn't say.
Although still unknown to me, it was a mundane question that no doubt had a mundane answer.
I've always believed that the best mysteries are often solved by the <i>simplest of answers.</i>
However, the simplest answers are <i>never</i> the first to present themselves, that's what makes the game of the detective so rousing.
The letter promised even more of these <i>intoxicating</i> questions.
*2<color=#FF0000>A special event.<color=white>
*2<color=#FF0000>A popular nightclub.<color=white>
*2<color=#FF0000>An upcoming murder.<color=white>
<color=#FDFF81>The Bartender<color=white> who had signed the letter had left little else to go off of.
&2
Already I could feel my mind beginning to shake off the dust that had settled.
<color=#FDFF81>The Bartender<color=white> had asked for help.
<color=#FF0000>I will visit this nightclub. Learn the details of his suspicion...<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>And if there is a murderer... I will find them.<color=white>
*1<color=#FF0000>The game has begun.<color=white>
