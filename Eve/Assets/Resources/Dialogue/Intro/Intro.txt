This detective work is hard shit.
I haven't had a real case in almost 5 months now.
Sure I've had a few people drop by, but nothing more vexing than a case of lost keys.
I can tell I'm starting to lose my edge.
Like rust on a knife, all the signs are there.
My creative thinking, possibly the most important aspect of a good detective has gone to shit.
I'm stuck thinking of things as they appear. I've forgotten to see them for what they could be.
Nor do I question as much as I should.
It's insane what effect 5 months behind a desk can have on the human mind.
Probably the biggest sign of my mental rust is the fact that I didn't even notice when <color=#FF0000>The Letter<color=white> arrived.

It must have shown up today, I'm sure of that, but when? I couldn't say.
Although still unknown to me, it was a mundane question that no doubt had a mundane answer.
I've always believed that the best mysteries are often solved by <color=#FF0000>the simplest of answers.<color=white>
However, the simplest answers are never the first to present themselves, that's what makes the game of the detective so rousing.
The letter promised even more of these intoxicating questions.
<color=#FF0000>A special event.<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>A popular nightclub.<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>A possible murder.<color=white>
<color=#FDFF81>The Bartender<color=white> who had signed the letter had left little else to go off of.

Already I could feel my mind beginning to shake off the dust that had settled.
<color=#FDFF81>The Bartender<color=white> had asked for <color=#FF0000>help.<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>I will visit this nightclub. Learn the details of his suspicion...<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>And if there is a murderer I will find them.<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>The game has begun.<color=white>
