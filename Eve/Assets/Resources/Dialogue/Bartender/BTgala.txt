@You
You mentioned a <color=#FF0000>Special Gala<color=white> earlier, what's that got to do with anything?
@Bartender
Ah, our annual <color=#FF0000>Crimson Gala.<color=white>
I'm not sure what makes it special to the murderers, but we host it every year.
It's quite the event, everyone gets dressed up in special outfits and we decorate the club a deep red.
@You
You decorate the entire club red?
@Bartender
Yep, it sounds strange I know, but <color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> says that red is an "alluring" color.
He might be right about that. <color=#FF0000>The Crimson Gala<color=white> is always our most popular night of the year.
We serve special drinks, and <color=#FF0000>everyone who's anyone will be there<color=white>, we've already started selling tickets and are almost full.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Sounds like this would be the perfect night for a murder...)<color=white>
If it makes so much money, why not have the club do it all the time.
@Bartender
You sure you're a detective? If we hosted a <color=#FF0000>Gala<color=white> every night, it wouldn't be special.
There's no way we'd make as much money.
@You
I put clues together to save lives; I'll let my accountant handle the money.
@Bartender
Sorry, didn't mean any offence.
@You
None taken, just trying to get as much info as possible.
@Bartender
Good to hear it, is there anything else you would like to know?
