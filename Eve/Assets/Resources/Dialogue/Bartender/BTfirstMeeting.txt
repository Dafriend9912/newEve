@Bartender
Ah! you must be <color=#FDFF81>The Detective<color=white>
@You
Yep, I'm guessing you're <color=#FDFF81>The Bartender<color=white>
@Bartender
Uh-huh. Thanks for coming, I wouldn't have asked for you if this wasn't very important
@You
Of course, any murder is serious business, but you've got to tell me more. How do you even know a murder is going to happen?
@Bartender
Well... to be completely honest, I don't have any evidence.
Two nights ago as I was trying to place a call to my wife to tell her I'd be home later than usual.
When I picked up the phone <color=#FF0000>I found that it was already in use.<color=white>
I overheard <color=#FF0000>two voices<color=white> talking.
They mentioned the <color=#FF0000>Gala<color=white> that's set to take place in one week.
Said it'd be the perfect time for their plan.
At first I was confused. We do have a <color=#FF0000>Special Gala<color=white> coming up, but I don't think any "events" have been finalized yet.
Then they mentioned <color=#FF0000>murder.<color=white> <color=#FF0000>Something about revenge.<color=white>
At this point I realized that one of the people on the phone must be <color=#FF0000>somewhere here in the club<color=white> with me.
There's only <color=#FF0000>two other phones<color=white> here. One in The Owner's office, and one behind the stage.
I quietly put the phone back down to go look for them so I could figure out who it was.
I must have not been as quiet as I thought I was because when I got behind stage, whoever was on the phone had left.
<color=#FF0000>The phone was hanging off the hook<color=white> though, so I'm sure they must have been there!
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Hmm... so there might be two murderers involved in this case...)</color>
@Bartender
I went and talked to <color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> about cancelling the Gala, but he said that was insane, and that he wouldn't do it without concrete evidence.
That's why I hired you.
I'm sorry I don't know much more than that, but you should ask around.
<color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> knows the most of what's going on around here.
<color=#FDFF81>The Main Dancer<color=white> is who you'll want to talk to if you want to know more about people. She's the clubs most popular dancer and she knows it.
Also if you've got a minute, you could talk to <color=#FDFF81>The Musician<color=white> he's a good friend of mine.
