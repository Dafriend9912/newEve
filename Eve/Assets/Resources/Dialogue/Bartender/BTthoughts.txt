@You
You seem to know the most about the case so far, what are your thoughts on it?
@Bartender
Not too much to say honestly.
I can't think of anyone who'd be a potential target, nor can I think of any one who'd be a potential murderer.
I do think it's strange though that the way I overheard this was <color=#FF0000>through a phone call.</color>
<color=#FF0000>That must mean that at least one of the murderers works here at the club right?</color>
@You
That's precisely what I was thinking.
Do you think it's possible both murderers work here?
@Bartender
It's possible
I'm usually one of the last people to leave at night, so if they needed to communicate, it's likely that one of them had already gone home for the day.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(So I know one of them must work here, but can't be sure that they both work here...)</color>
@Bartender
Any other way I can help?
