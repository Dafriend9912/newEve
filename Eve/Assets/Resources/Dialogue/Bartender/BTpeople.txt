@You
You seem to get a lot of human traffic here at the bar. Can you tell me more about some of the workers or customers?
@Bartender
Of course.
<color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> is an okay guy. I've been working here for years now and he's never done anything awful.
He pays well and manages the club, but I think there might be something bad between him and <color=#FDFF81>The Stage Director.</color>
<color=#FDFF81>The Dancers<color=white> are all alright.
Full honesty, <color=#FF0000>I don't care for them at all,<color=white> all stuck up pricks if you ask me, but they're part of working in a club
<color=#FDFF81>The Musician<color=white> and I are <color=#FF0000>good friends.<color=white> He started here a little over a year ago. <color=#FF0000>I don't think he's a big fan of this place,<color=white> but it pays the bills.
As for customers, we have a couple regulars here.
There's a young man who comes in here a couple times a week.
He's got a <color=#FF0000>fiery temper, takes everything as an insult and always seems to be compensating for something.</color>
<color=#FF0000>Always spends a large amount of money on two dancers in particular.</color>
He seems to think he's got an actual chance with them, sorry sap.
Do you know <color=#FDFF81>The Boxer<color=white>? he's a boxes at a nearby ring and sometimes comes around.
He rarely talks, and <color=#FF0000>sometimes gets into fistfights.</color>
There's also a fellow who comes by every now and then.
He's a real big shot, <color=#FF0000>makes a lot of money gambling<color=white> at a nearby casino.
That being said, he's very smart with his money, and <color=#FF0000>equally cunning.<color=white>
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Sounds like I'll have to wait to see the customers, but I should be able to go find that boxer now if I want to...)</color>
Thanks for the help.
@Bartender
Of course, is there any other way I can help?
