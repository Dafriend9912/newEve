@You
What about this Gala coming up?
@Owner
URGH!
The Gala is the reason I'm so busy right now!
It's great for sales, but it always makes so much work!
I've got to buy the costumes, buy the alcohol, and buy the decorations.
It's in only 5 days now and I haven't even started!
URGH!
I've got too much to do.
@You
If the Gala is such a busy time, why not have other co-workers help out?
@Owner
What?? Entrust my precious annual Gala to the likes of them??
The only one I trust to do his work around here is the stage manager!
He knows how to set up a good show, and a good show is exactly what we need!
The Gala is extrememely important to my business, the nightclub will always be packed during it!
I'll make so much money!
@You
The Bartender must have told you that the Gala is when the possible murder will happen right?
@Owner
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Asking me to cancel the Gala on a mere suspicion?
Insane! I wont do it!
@You
You'd endanger your own staff just for the sake of the Gala?
@Owner
You don't seem to get it either.
THEY ARE NOT IN DANGER!
THERE WILL BE NO MURDER!
