@You
You keep saying that you're very busy, but I don't see how you have all this work to do...
@Owner
What are you implying?
@You
Nothing yet, but I'm starting to suspect you're not telling me something.
@Owner
I've got a lot of work to do!
@You
That's not the problem I have with your statement.
You may have a lot of work to do, but it doesn't sound like you're even trying to get it done.
@Owner
URGH!
That's... That's not true!
Show me the evidence Mr. "Detective".
@You
For starters, you didn't even know I was here investigating the club.
You also say that the Gala is in less than a week, but it sounds like you haven't even started with preparations.
