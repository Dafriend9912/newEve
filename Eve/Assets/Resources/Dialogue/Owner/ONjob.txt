@You
Can you tell me what you do around here?
@Owner
What I do? What I DO?
Please, I run this whole operation.
Nothing passes through the club without me knowing about it!
@You
(And yet he somehow didn't know about me...)
@Owner
I run the books around here!
I make the money around here!
I'm a very busy man!
Yes, very busy taking care of the nightclub.
This nightclub has been in my possession for 9 years now, of course I take care of it!
Not just the club either!
I have to deal with everyone who works here too.
That's the real pain, a bunch of idiots!
They always think that they can get away with not listening to me!
Not The Stage Director though, he's a good man.
Got a real head on his shoulders!
@You
The Stage Di-
@Owner
Yes of course The Stage Director!
You should go talk to him!
I'm much too busy to keep sharing about "my job"
