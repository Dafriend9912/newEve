@You
You're probably wondering why I'm bothering to talk to you at all.
I've heard that you've been coming around the club occasionally.
@Boxer
Yeah, what of it?
@You
I'm investigating a potential murder.
Anyone who has ties to the club is currently a potential suspect.
@Boxer
Potential murder?
@You
Yes, I'll spare you the details, but can you tell me more about why you come around the club?
@Boxer
I come around the club for the same reasons as everyone else.
I'm a man living in this shithole district looking for some break from my daily life.
@You
Maybe, but it seems like you've had some confrontations there
@Boxer
Yeah, I've had some fights there, but I have fights everywhere I go.
I've made mistakes in my past, but I'm trying to get over them.
People like you that keep bringing up my past are what keeps me from getting over it.
Ask your next question or get out!
