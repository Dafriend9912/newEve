@You
I won't bullshit you.
From what I've heard, and what I've seen, you're quite the force.
Would you consider yourself a dangerous person?
@Boxer
Right to the heart of it eh?
Do you know why I chose to box?
@You
Tell me.
@Boxer
All throughout childhood I got in fights.
Looking back on it, they were always over stupid things.
...
I'm not inherently a bad person, but I was never able to control my wrath.
I took up boxing to channel some of that rage into something at least somewhat productive.
@You
So you take out your emotions on your opponent?
@Boxer
Yes.
@You
And this works?
@Boxer
Not for the sorry sap that I'm pummeling at the time, but it's done wonders for me.
I suppose me roughing up one capable boxer every few days is also better for society as a whole huh?
I still have some costly slip ups, but for the most part, fighting in the ring helps me contain my anger outside of it.
@You
(Sounds like he's genuine about why he fights at least...)
@Boxer
Listen, I know I've been a danger in the past, but I'm getting better at remaining peaceful.
