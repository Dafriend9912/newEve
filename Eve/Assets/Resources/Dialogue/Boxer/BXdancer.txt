@You
I'd like to ask about one of your past relationships
@Boxer
...
@You
(Guess that wasn't what he wanted to hear)
@Boxer
You'll be wanting to talk about The Dancer then.
@You
Yes.
I spoke to her, and she mentioned that you and her had some issues in the past.
@Boxer
Listen, I don't want to talk about that Bitch, but leave it at what she said, those issues are in the past.
Being with her was the worst decision I've ever made.
She was arrogant and manipulative.
She knew about my anger issue, and she knew exactly what buttons to push.
I think she wanted to test me, to see just how far I would go when enraged.
I knew I wouldn't forgive myself if I ever laid a hand on her, so I didn't.
Still, all those emotions had to go somewhere.
I was unchained, furious almost all the time.
I could barely go an hour without breaking something, or someone.
She finally dumped me.
@You
Did anything happen after?
@Boxer
Sure I made some bad choices, following the break up, but that was probably the best ending for us.
I learned a lot about myself from that relationship.
Since then I've been working on making myself a better person.
You can even ask my psychiatrist, I've way more docile now than I was before.
@You
(Sounds like he may be a bit better than before... And I can defiently see what he meant about The Dancer...)
I'll take your word for it.
