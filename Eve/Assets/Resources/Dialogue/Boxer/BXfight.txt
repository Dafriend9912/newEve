@You
You probably didn't see me in the crowd, but I watched your fight.
@Boxer
...
Ok.
@You
I don't think I've ever seen someone fight with that much intensity.
@Boxer
You must not frequent the ring then.
@You
That's true, but your style seems like it's a cut above the rest.
@Boxer
...
Thats true...
@You
(Was that pride in his eyes I just saw...?)
@You
Ok. I'll say it.
You seem vicious in the ring.
@Boxer
I am.
I haven't lost a fight in years.
I'm actually running out of people to fight.
I leave 'em all in pretty bad shape.
@You
What drives you to fight like that?
@Boxer
...
Anger I guess.
I'm not proud of it.
Honestly, It's not a good quality of mine, I know that.
But I'm able to channel that rage I feel right through my fists, into my oppenents jaw.
I haven't lost a fight in years because the more beating I take, the more I can dish out.
@You
(He defiently seems dangerous, but he also seems almost remorseful...)
@Boxer
You didn't come all the way here just to ask about my last fight did you?
@You
No I didn't
