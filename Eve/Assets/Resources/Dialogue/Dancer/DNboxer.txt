@You
I'd like to go back to something you mentioned earlier.
@Dancer
Ok.
@You
It was when you were talking about the men here.
You said that you <color=#FF0000>"almost never"<color=white> accept their offers.
Are there any men that you have given a chance?
@Dancer
Yeah, there have been a few almost worthy men.
@You
Can you tell me about them?
@Dancer
Sure, I guess you'll want to hear about my most recent fling. He's the most interesting anyways.
This man started coming around here about a year ago.
I was instantly drawn to him because <color=#FF0000>he was built like a tank. Easily over 6 foot, and packed with muscle.<color=white>
I got to talking with him, and he told me he was <color=#FDFF81>A Boxer<color=white> at a nearby ring.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Oh I think the bartender mentioned this guy also...)<color=white>
@Dancer
He wasn't that interesting at first, kind of quiet and suprisingly kind.
I thought for sure this man couldn't be a Boxer.
<color=#FF0000>That was until I saw him fight.<color=white>
@You
You went to some of his matches?
@Dancer
Yes I did, but <color=#FF0000>I first saw him fight here in the club.<color=white>
One of the waitresses spilled his drink on him as she walked past.
His eyes lit up with what I could only describe as <color=#FF0000>pure wrath.<color=white>
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(This doesn't sounds like it ends too happily...)<color=white>
@Dancer
He sprung up with a quickness only years in the ring would bring.
Within seconds he was on top of the waitress, beating the shit out of her.
Another patron tried to pull him off, but <color=#FDFF81>The Boxer<color=white> was too consumed with anger.
<color=#FF0000>He spun around and started beating the shit out of him too.<color=white>
I'm sure the other man would have died, but <color=#FDFF81>The Bartender <color=#FF0000>pulled out the gun he keeps behind the counter.<color=white>
That slowed <color=#FDFF81>The Boxer<color=white> down real quick.
It was awful... But at the same time, It was the most emotion I've ever seen from someone here...
<color=#FF0000>Honestly, it made me fall for him even harder...<color=white>
@You
What happened to him?
@Dancer
Well, he got kicked out the club, but <color=#FF0000>I was so infatuated by him<color=white> at this point, I begged <color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> to let him back in.
He eventually caved to my wishes, and <color=#FDFF81>The Boxer<color=white> returned to his kind self.
He thanked me for allowing him back into the club, and we got to talking.
<color=#FF0000>We ended up dating for a few months...<color=white>
@You
Only a few months?
@Dancer
A man with a <color=#FF0000>streak of red hot rage<color=white> would be better left alone.
<color=#FF0000>His fists never met me.<color=white> I was careful enough to never make a mistake around him.
But everywhere we went, <color=#FF0000>he'd leave a trail of broken bones of those that had "wronged" him.<color=white>
I decided to play it safe, and <color=#FF0000>leave him before he could do the same to me.<color=white>
@You
What's he up to now?
@Dancer
Not too sure, we don't talk anymore.
<color=#FF0000>He stopped coming around the club.<color=white>
He probably still boxes at the nearby ring.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(If he's as dangerous as she says he is, I'll probably have to talk to him...)<color=white>
@Dancer
If you're thinking of talking to him, he shouldn't be hard to find.
<color=#FF0000>But I'd avoid him if you value your health.<color=white>
@You
Unfortunately that's not a privilege I can afford right now.
