@You
Can you tell me about any of the patrons here
@Main Dancer
Sure, although there aren't too many.
There's this one short man who comes in pretty frequently.
He always asks for either me, or my backup dancer
He pays really well, so I try to treat him nicely, but he's really not my type.
He's got way too much confidence for a man of his stature.
@You
(Sounds like this dancer has some real disdain for some of these customers...)
There's also another man who comes in every now and then.
I think he must be a gambler or something, because he always spends a decent amount of money, but manages to seem guarded and cunning with his money.
We've talked once, but he doesn't spend much money on me. I wonder why.
@You
(I wouldn't be spending money on you either once I heard you talk...)
