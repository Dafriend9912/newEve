@You
Can you tell me about any of the patrons here
@Dancer
Sure, although there aren't too many.
There's this one short man who comes in pretty frequently.
<color=#FF0000>He always asks for either me, or my backup dancer<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>He pays really well,<color=white> so I try to treat him nicely, but he's really not my type.
He's got way too much confidence for a man of his stature.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Sounds like this dancer has some real disdain for some of these customers...)<color=white>
@Dancer
There's also another man who comes in every now and then.
I think <color=#FF0000>he must be a gambler<color=white> or something, because he always spends a decent amount of money, but manages to seem guarded and cunning with his money.
We've talked once, <color=#FF0000>but he doesn't spend much money on me.<color=white> I wonder why.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(I wouldn't be spending money on you either once I heard you talk...)<color=white>
