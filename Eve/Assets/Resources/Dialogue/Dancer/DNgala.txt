@You
What can you tell me about this Gala coming up?
@Main Dancer
Oh the Gala!
I love the Gala!
@You
(Sounds like I asked the right question...)
@Main Dancer
During the Gala I get to treat everyone like the shit they are!
@You
(Huh...?)
@Main Dancer
The Owner makes me treat the customers with respect usually.
I'm allowed to laugh at their pathetic lives when they try to talk to me in person, but when I'm working, I have to pretend that the short smelly man in front of me is a actually a tall muscular greek god.
It's just business. 
but the Gala is completely different.
It's really the only night where I can really let my feelings show.
@You
(This is not what I was expecting...)
Why is the Gala different?
@Main Dancer
Well, we decorate the club, and have extra special drinks, but more importantly, we have unique costumes that we wear.
This means I get to create a unique personality for that night.
What a better fake personality than revealing my true feelings?
@You
And that works?
@Main Dancer
Oh yeah!
Everyone who hasn't really met me assumes it's just an act.
Some of the perverts here even get off to that kind of thing you know.
@You
(Guess I know her thoughts on the event then...)
