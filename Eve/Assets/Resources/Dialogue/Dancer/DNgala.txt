@You
What can you tell me about this <color=#FF0000>Gala<color=white> coming up?
@Dancer
Oh <color=#FF0000>the Gala!<color=white>
I love <color=#FF0000>the Gala!<color=white>
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Sounds like I asked the right question...)<color=white>
@Dancer
During the <color=#FF0000>Gala I get to treat everyone like the shit they are!<color=white>
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Huh...?)<color=white>
@Dancer
<color=#FDFF81>The Owner<color=white> makes me treat the customers with respect usually.
I'm allowed to laugh at their <color=#FF0000>pathetic lives<color=white> when they try to talk to me in person, but when I'm working, I have to pretend that the short smelly man in front of me is a actually a tall muscular greek god.
<color=#FF0000>It's just business.<color=white>
but <color=#FF0000>the Gala<color=white> is completely different.
<color=#FF0000>It's really the only night where I can really let my feelings show.<color=white>
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(This is not what I was expecting...)<color=white>
Why is <color=#FF0000>the Gala<color=white> different?
@Dancer
Well, we decorate the club, and have extra special drinks, but more importantly, we have unique costumes that we wear.
This means <color=#FF0000>I get to create a unique personality for that night.<color=white>
<color=#FF0000>What a better fake personality than revealing my true feelings?<color=white>
@You
And that works?
@Dancer
Oh yeah!
Everyone who hasn't really met me assumes it's just an act.
<color=#FF0000>Some of the perverts here even get off to that kind of thing<color=white> you know.
@You
<color=#6EEFFF>(Guess I know her thoughts on the event then...)<color=white>
