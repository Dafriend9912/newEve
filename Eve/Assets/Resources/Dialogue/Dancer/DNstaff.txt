@You
Can you tell me a bit more about the people who work here?
@Main Dancer
Sure.
You've already met the Bartender, so I won't talk to much about him.
He doesn't seem to like me. Probably because I'm so popular here.
The Owner pays really well, but beyond that he seems to always be busy.
I can't help but think that if he really is as busy as he says he is, this place wouldn't be such a dump.
@You
(It looks like this club is prety good shape...)
@Main Dancer
I'd recommend staying away from the Stage Director, I have to talk with him almost everyday as he controls most of what we do, but he's evil.
I don't just mean he's rude, he's got a mean streak in him.
I don't ever mess up, I'm much too good for that, but I've heard from some of the other dancers that you don't want to make any mistakes around him.
Speaking of other dancers, you should go talk to my Backup Dancer.
She's definetely not as good as I am, but she sometimes fills in for me on nights I'm not here.
That's about it for the staff here.
