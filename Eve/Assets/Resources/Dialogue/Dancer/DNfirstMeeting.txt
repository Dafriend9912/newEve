@Main Dancer
...No that's stupid, why would I want to do that?
@You
(Hmm she's on the phone...)
@Main Dancer
I don't care if that's what you want, what makes you think I'd want that?
@You
(I should probably interrupt her, but now I'm curious about this call...)
@Main Dancer
Fine, just stop calling me until you've got a real job!
@You
(Looks like she's noticed me...)
Hi, are you th-
@Main Dancer
What the hell? How did you get back here?
Nevermind, I don't care.
I'm not going to give you any of my time, so you better walk away before I get someone to kick your ass!
@You
This is important. Are you the Main Dancer around here?
@Main Dancer
Don't act like you didn't know that you perv!
Everyone here knows me!
How long have you been coming to the club?
I bet you're dying for a piece of me just like every other loser who comes here.
@You
(She seems pretty arrogant, this is defiently the Dancer the Bartender told me about...)
I'm not a patron here, I'm a detective.
@Main Dancer
!!!
Detective?
I ain't done nothing wrong!
@You
(It's incredible how often I hear that in my line of work...)
I didn't say you did, but I'd like to make sure you won't.
@Main Dancer
What is this all about?
@You
Well, it started from a phone call The Bartender heard two nights ago...
@   
...
...
@You
...And then The Bartender said I should come talk to you, so here I am.
@Main Dancer
Well he's right that I'm easily the most popular person around here.
